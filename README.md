### That Fox 28 Oct
> How I longed to gather you and your children as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you were unwilling” (Luke 13:34).
> Eph 6:10-20; Luke 13:31-35

Jesus laments the terrible fate of Jerusalem in two passages in Luke found in Chapters 13 and 19. He weeps over the city for its failure to accept God’s offer of peace. Instead, after his death, zealots will incite a war against Rome and the city will be destroyed and a million people killed. In today’s Gospel, he uses the poignant image of a mother hen gathering her chicks under her wings. He is already a hunted man under threat from Herod (whom Jesus calls “that fox”). How many foxes now plot their own agendas to gain power over others in our world? But nothing will deter Jesus from his mission to offer God’s unconditional love to those who will accept it.

The Gospel comforts and instructs us, but it also warns us to repent of selfish attitudes and behaviors that ultimately lead to spiritual death. While we entertain ourselves with distractions and delusions, the world is being devoured by war and greed. We have only the time allotted to our brief lives to figure how to make a difference.  

Jesuit Egnacio Ellacuria, murdered in 1989 by U.S.-trained soldiers during the civil war in El Salvador, wrote that history was in the grasp of extractive capitalism and headed in the wrong direction. It had become a death trip, not just for the billions of poor being crucified by its oppressive practices, but also for the planet itself.

A different world is needed. A different world is possible, but only with a global awakening to what privilege and comfort for the few at the top of the economic pyramid are costing the many on whose backs it is being built.

The world is a shining city on a hill for some, but that city is the Jerusalem over which Jesus wept. History will judge us all for our complicity in the destruction of the environment and so many lives. It is something to weep about, then do everything in our power to change while we still have time.



### A walk on the wild side 27 Oct
> Strive to enter through the narrow gate…” (Luke 13:22).
> Eph 6:1-9; Lk 13:22-30

The Word took me to the “Wild Side” this morning by invoking the memory of a classic tune written by the late songwriter Lou Reed. The lyrics to “Take a Walk on the Wild Side” invited me to reflect on just how radical Jesus must have seemed to his contemporaries. He was a poet and storyteller who came from outside the theological establishment. He quickly gained a questionable reputation for associating with society’s misfits and outcasts, and he had the audacity to say that God sought them out and loved them.

How easy it would have been to reject this strange yet charismatic figure when he came to Jerusalem and stirred things up.  He called out on the Temple priesthood by disrupting the money exchange and animal markets and, in doing so, provoking the Roman authorities, who took their cut of that revenue.

In today’s Gospel, Jesus addresses the challenge of entering God’s Kingdom through the “narrow gate,” then said that many sinners would get in while those who thought they had an automatic pass would be too proud to fit through the portal.

It is a curious image coming from someone who seemed to be throwing the gates of heaven wide open to anyone seeking God’s unconditional love.  It also suggested a whole set of paradoxes that describe God’s mysterious ways:  The first will be last and the last will be first; Mercy and compassion, not sacrifice or legal purity, are what get God’s attention.

Of course, God blesses virtue and discipline because they make for an orderly life, but God is also on the lookout for the lost and the broken-hearted, life’s chaotic radicals and troublemakers. Jesus’ many parables imagine God heading out into the night to roam the steamy underground of forbidden and dangerous haunts to retrieve a beloved son, a reckless daughter, an abused child of the streets. This is what Jesus did, and this is why he became an outcast himself.

Reed’s "Walk on the Wild Side" was a shocking, ironic anthem to society’s misfits, hustlers and gender-bending radicals. Many listeners, drawn to the song’s browsy bass lines, sexy drum and saxophone backup, may have missed Reed’s lyric narrative, but the song inspired a generation of artists to use their music to invite listeners to consider the humanity of those left outside the mainstream.

In the same way, Jesus, God’s probe into the shadow side of human nature, went to the Wild Side to take upon himself the rejection that made his death on the cross inevitable but also redeemed us all --every one of us-- for glory.

Here is a paradox in the parable: Enter by the narrow gate. Do not count on religion to save you if you hate your brothers and sisters for their sins. Be prepared to follow Jesus wherever he goes.
